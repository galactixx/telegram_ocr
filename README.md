This repository contains a specialized tool designed to scan and analyze images from cryptocurrency-focused Telegram channels. Utilizing advanced vision and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) methods, the tool efficiently parses images to extract information about specific crypto tokens.

NOTE:
Examples and vision classes work fine. The telegram connection has to be tested so that area of it is still a WIP.
